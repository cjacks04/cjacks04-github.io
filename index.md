## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the [The Information School](https://ischool.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I co-direct the [Collaborative Computing Group](https://collab.ischool.wisc.edu/). I am also a faculty affiliate in the [UW-Madison Robert & Jean Holtz Center for Science and Technology Studies](https://sts.wisc.edu), the [UW-Madison Institute for Diversity Science](https://ids.wisc.edu), and the [UW-Madison Data Science Institute](https://datascience.wisc.edu/institute/). I received a PhD in Information Science and Technology (2019) from the [Information School](https://ischool.syr.edu/) at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu/). After my PhD, I spent one year as a teaching postdoc in Berkeley's Master's in Data Science ([MIDS](https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/)) program. 

My area of research lies at the intersection of Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) and human-centered design/computing. My work investigates the approaches to enhancing contribution by crowds in online environments. Using mixed-methods approaches and data science techniques, I investigations how people (''the crowd'') contributes to and participates in virtual citizen science. Prior research projects have included: studying the motivations of volunteer crowd workers, investigating learning behaviors, using theory-based motivational cues to enhance pariticpation, and investigating the coordinative mechanisms of knowledge production.  

 Ongoing research considers approaches to diversity the crowd in various contexts. This work involves research using participatory design to re-imagine how new systems and digital tools might enhance approaches to involve underrepresented groups in informing and shaping environmental policy. Additional projects focus on approaches to enhance and diversify definitions of fairness in machine learning audits.  

My research has been published in leading conferences and journals in HCI such as *ACM Conference On Computer-Supported Cooperative Work And Social Computing*, the *Journal of the Association for Information Systems*, and *Computers in Human Behavior*. The research has been funded by the National Science Foundation ([HCC](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1755628&HistoricalAwards=false)), the [Rockefeller Foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org), the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com), and the [UW-Madison Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education](https://research.wisc.edu/funding/).
