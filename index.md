## About Me

I am an Assistant Professor in the [The Information School](https://ischool.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I co-direct the [Collaborative Computing Group](https://collab.ischool.wisc.edu/) with [Adam Rule](https://adamrule.com/) and [Jacob Thebault-Spieker](https://jacob.thebault-spieker.com/). I received a PhD in Information Science and Technology (2019) from the [Information School](https://ischool.syr.edu/) at [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu/) where I worked with [Kevin Crowston](https://crowston.syr.edu/) and [Carsten Ã˜sterlund](https://ischool.syr.edu/carsten-osterlund/). After my PhD, I spent one-year as a teaching postdoc in Berkeley's Master's in Data Science ([MIDS](https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/)) program. 

## Research Interests

My area of research lies at the intersection of Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) and human-centered design/computing. I approach investigations through empirical investigations of how people contribute to and participate in virtual environments. Prior research projects have included: studying the motivations of volunteer crowd workers, investigating the arrangement of learning resources in informal learning environments, conducting online experiments using theory-based motivational cues, and investigating the coordinative mechanisms of knowledge production in online communities. As a faculty member, this work has been funded (with a multi-institution collaborative grant) by the National Science Foundation ([HCC](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1755628&HistoricalAwards=false)).
