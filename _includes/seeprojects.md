          <div class="title"><a href="">Amplifying the Voices of Black and Latinx Communities in  Environmental Policy Discussions (2023-Current)</a></div>
      <div class="author">In this proposal, we describe research to develop innovative digital tools and practices to increase civic engagement among underrepresented communities in the area of community deliberation and advocacy in policymaking. This project will enable individuals and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), who often represent the interests of community members, to participate in deliberations and policies on environmental issues. Many questions arise when considering how to support underrepresented communities in deliberation and advocacy  -  What are the current capabilities for community deliberation and advocacy work? What information and data are required for effective dialogues? How to ensure trust in the process? The project addresses only a handful of the questions above through the convergence of diverse areas of expertise from the PI and Co-PI —human-centered design, science communication, data science, and environmental policymaking.</div>

          <div class="title"><a href="">Coupling deliberation and digital crowdsourcing to amplify and engage marginalized communities in co-creating solutions for carbon-dioxide policies (2022-Current)</a></div>
      <div class="author">Despite well-documented disparities in climate’s impact on communities of color, these communities’ voices are not represented equally in the social and the digital discussions due to digital, social, and political communication barriers. Using carbon-dioxide policy as a case study, this project aims to tackle this broad research question: How can we couple deliberation and digital crowdsourcing designs to engage and amplify the voices of communities of color in carbon-dioxide policymaking?</div>
